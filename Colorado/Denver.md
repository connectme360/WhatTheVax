Colorado is currently in Phase 1 of the state's vaccination timeline. There are two vaccines being produced by Pfizer and Moderna. Both vaccines require two doses of the vaccine approximately 21 days apart. The companies report that both vaccines are around 95% effective. The city and county of Denver and the State of Colorado are ensuring that every person who receives their first dose will be able to access a second dose in the correct time frame. 

The vaccine will be free, but some providers may ask for insurance so they can bill for the vaccine administration fee. Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance will cover the cost of the COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, uninsured Coloradoans will ahve access to free vaccines. 

The vaccine will **not** be mandated by any agency or organization, as it is under the [Emergency Use Authorization](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained)
